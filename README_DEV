To properly setup your dev environment, you need to:

1.	Install the google appengine development server. See this
	page for info: http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstarted/devenvironment.html

2.	Set the ${google_app_engine} property on your PyDev project
	so that PyDev will have the app engine libraries available.
	Edit the .pydevproject file in the root of the trac-rpc-lib
	folder and change this to reflect your system settings:
	
	<key>google_appengine_home</key>
	<value>/home/ray/apps/google_appengine</value>
	
	
Happy coding!
