pawprint -- a mobile interface to your Trac

I couldn't find any mobile interface to Trac, so I decided to write one 
myself. This project is broken into two main pieces: the Trac RPC library, 
a google-app-engine app which provides easy-to-use web service-esque 
functions for making authenticated RPC calls to Trac, and the Mobile App, which 
provides the UI and application logic for interacting with Trac.

The app is built atop Sencha Touch, providing an HTML 5 implementation for 
device agnostic viewing. Enjoy!
