pawprint -- a mobile interface to your Trac

I couldn't find any mobile interface to Trac, so I decided to write one myself. This project is broken into two main pieces: the JSON RPC library, which provides easy-to-use functions for making the RPC calls to Trac, and the Mobile App, which provides the UI and application logic for interacting with Trac.

The app is built atop Sencha Touch, providing an HTML 5 implementation for device agnostic viewing. Enjoy!
